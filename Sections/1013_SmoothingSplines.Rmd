Smoothing splines \citep{Wahba1990, Spath1995} offer a simple approach for fitting a curve through data that avoids overfitting by penalizing the curvature of the spline \citep{Reinsch1967}. Smoothing splines replace the bandwidth selection problem of kernel regression with a penalty parameter selection problem.

In this section, we focus on periodic cubic smoothing splines in the bivariate setting. Starting with the natural interpolating cubic spline, we show how to adapt the constraints so that the interpolating spline is a periodic function. A penalty on the spline's curvature is added and we show how optimizing this objective function results in a smoothed periodic spline. Finally, we discuss smoothing splines which attempt to control smoothing independently at each individual knot.

Consider a tabulated function $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$ with $x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n$. A natural cubic spline is a function $\fnc{s}{x}=\fnc{s_i}{x}$ on $\brac{x_i, x_{i+1}}$ for $i = 1, \dots, n-1$ with the properties:

  1. $\fnc{s_i}{x} = A_i + B_i\paren{x - x_i} + C_i\paren{x - x_i}^2 + D_i\paren{x - x_i}^3$ is a cubic polynomial;
  1. the second derivative, $\fnc{s^{(2)}}{x}$, exists and is continuous on $\brac{x_1, x_n}$;
  1. $s_i^{(j)}(x_{i+1}) = s_{i+1}^{(j)}(x_{i+1})$ for $i = 1, \dots, n-1$ and derivatives $j = 0, 1, 2$;
  1. $s(x_i)=y_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$;
  1. $s^{(2)}(x_1) = s^{(2)}(x_n) = 0$.

The natural cubic spline is the unique solution to a linear system of $n-2$ equations in $n-2$ unknown second derivatives, $\fnc{s_i^{(2)}}{x_i} = \g_i$ for $i = 2, \dots, n-1$. Interpolating periodic cubic splines replace the property, $s''(x_1) = s''(x_n) = 0$, with the periodicity constraints $s_1^{(j)}(x_1) = s_{n-1}^{(j)}(x_{n})$ for $j = 0, 1, 2$ so that $\fnc{s}{x}$ has wavelength $x_n - x_1$. This results in an additional unknown, $\g_1=\g_n$.

Suppose we have bivariate observations $(x_1, y_1), \dots (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})$ transformed to polar coordinates $(\t_i, \rho_i)$, $i = 1, \dots, n-1$. Our goal is to find a polar function, $\fnc{s}{\t}$, interpolating through each point. The knots are the angular components $\t_i$ ordered so that $0 \leq \t_1 < \cdots < \t_{n-1} < 2\pi$. We create point $(\t_{n}, \rho_{n}) = (\t_1 + 2\pi, \rho_{1})$ so that our function has wavelength $2\pi$. 

The resulting system of $n-1$ equations with $n-1$ unknown second derivatives in matrix notation is \eeq[ipcs-matrix]{
  H\gbm = G\rhobm,
} where \begin{align*}
  H &= \bmat{\frac{h_{n-1} + h_1}{3} & \frac{h_1}{6} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & \frac{h_{n-1}}{6} \\
        \frac{h_1}{6} & \frac{h_1 + h_{2}}{3} & \frac{h_2}{6} & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \frac{h_2}{6} & \frac{h_2 + h_{3}}{3} & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & \frac{h_{n-3}}{6} & \frac{h_{n-3} + h_{n-2}}{3} & \frac{h_{n-2}}{6} \\
        \frac{h_{n-1}}{6} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & \frac{h_{n-2}}{6} & \frac{h_{n-2} + h_{n-1}}{3} }, \qquad \text{for } h_i = \t_{i+1} - \t_i, \\
  G &= \bmat{\text{-}\!\paren{\frac{1}{h_1}\! +\! \frac{1}{h_{n-1}}} & \frac{1}{h_1} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{h_{n-1}} \\
        \frac{1}{h_1} & \text{-}\!\paren{\frac{1}{h_1}\! +\! \frac{1}{h_2}} & \frac{1}{h_2} & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & \frac{1}{h_{n-3}} & \text{-}\!\paren{\frac{1}{h_{n-3}}\! +\! \frac{1}{h_{n-2}}} & \frac{1}{h_{n-2}} \\
        \frac{1}{h_{n-1}} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & \frac{1}{h_{n-2}} & \text{-}\!\paren{\frac{1}{h_{n-2}}\! +\! \frac{1}{h_{n-1}}} },
  \end{align*}
$\gbm = \paren{\g_1, \g_2, \g_3, \dots, \g_{n-3}, \g_{n-2}, \g_{n-1} }\tr$ and $\rhobm = \paren{\rho_1, \rho_2, \rho_3, \dots, \rho_{n-3}, \rho_{n-2}, \rho_{n-1} }\tr$. Solving Equation \eqref{Eq:ipcs-matrix} for unknown $\gbm$, the coefficients of the spline are \eeq[ipcs]{
  A_i = \rho_i; \qquad 
  B_i = d_i - \frac{1}{6}h_i\paren{\g_{i+1} + 2\g_i}; \qquad
  C_i = \frac{1}{2}\g_i; \qquad
  D_i = \frac{1}{6h_i}\paren{\g_{i+1} - \g_i}.
}

To avoid overfitting, we penalize curvature and find the vector $\sbf = \paren{\fnc{s}{\t_1}, \dots, \fnc{s}{\t_{n-1}}}$ that minimizes \eeq[smoothpenalty]{
  J_{\a}(s) = \a\sum_{i=1}^n\brac{\rho_i - s(\t_i)}^2 + (1 - \a)\int_{\t_1}^{\t_n}s''(\t)^2d\t
    = \a\paren{\rhobm - \sbf}\tr\paren{\rhobm - \sbf} + (1-\a)\sbf\tr G\tr H^{-1}G\sbf,
} where $\a \in [0, 1]$ is the penalty parameter. By checking the first order conditions, $\sbf$ has a closed form solution \eeq[smoothing-spline]{
  \frac{d}{d\sbf}J_{\a}(s) = 2\a(\rhobm - \sbf) + 2(1 - \a)H^{-1}G\sbf = 0 \simp \hat{\symbf{s}} = \brac{\a - (1 - \a)H^{-1}G}^{-1}\a\rhobm,
} and the smoothed periodic spline is the interpolating periodic spline through points $(\t_i, s_i)$, denoted $\fnc{\est{s}}{\t; \a}$.

We use periodic smoothing splines to estimate the conditional mean in Equation \eqref{Eq:condition-mean}. The smoothing spline estimator for $\fncD{r}{\cdot}$ is \eeq[ss-estimator]{
  \fncD{SS}{\t} = \frac{1}{\maxa[\t \in [0, 2\pi)]{\fnc{\est{s}}{\t; \a}}}\fnc{\est{s}}{\t; \a},
} where $\a$ is the smoothing penalty parameter. The penalty parameter is inversely related to the bias of the estimator and directly related to its variance. The smoothing parameter can be selected to optimize this bias-variance trade-off with methods such as cross-validation.

The estimator in Equation \eqref{Eq:ss-estimator} does not easily generalize to higher dimensions. For dimensionality $p > 2$, other approaches are required \citep[Ch. 2]{Wahba1990}. However, the bivariate case provides insight into some choices affecting the smoothing spline estimator such as the penalty criteria, selecting the penalty parameter, and the functional form of the spline. 

The periodic smoothing spline estimates for $D_1$ and $D_2$ are presented in Figure \ref{Fig:sim-1-spline} and Figure \ref{Fig:sim-1-spline}, respectively. The penalty parameter is selected using $K$-fold cross validation with $K=5$. The estimated boundary for $D_2$ fluctuates wildly, indicating either our method of selecting the penalty parameter is suboptimal or the smoothing spline estimator may be inappropriate.

In general, the smoothing spline estimator suffers from the global impositon of the penalty with no mechanism to penalize curvature differently in various regions. This problem can be addressed with flexible smoothing splines \citep{Spath1988}, but requires the user to input control parameters which weigh the penalty separately at each point. For points close together, the control parameters of these points significantly affect the shape of the spline, so it is desirable to pick a representative knot from these points thus reducing the number of control parameters and their effect. This problem of choosing representative knots is addressed by free-knot splines discussed in the next section.
