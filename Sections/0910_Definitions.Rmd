A set $D \ss \R^p$ is a *star-shaped set* with respect to center $\mub \in D$ if \eqq{
  \xb \in D \implies \xi\xb + \paren{1-\xi}\mub \in D, \qquad \text{for all} \ 0 < \xi < 1.
} As a result, any line segment from $\mub$ to any point in $D$ is completely contained in $D$. 

If $D$ is a bounded, open, star-shaped set with respect to center $\mub$ having a continuous boundary, there exists a unique function $n_D$ called the *gauge function* that gives an analytical description of $D$ with the following properties:
  
  (i) $D = \set{\xb \in \R^p : \fnc{n_D}{\xb-\mub} < 1}$ is bounded, open and star-shaped;
  (i) $\fnc{n_D}{t\paren{\xb - \mub}} = t\fnc{n_D}{\xb-\mub}$ for $t > 0$ and $\xb \in \R^p$.

The first property defines the *shape set* $D$ in terms of its gauge function. The second property states that the gauge function is a homogeneous function of degree 1.

As an illustration, consider an elliptical distribution in $\R^p$. The gauge function for the shape set of an elliptical distribution is of the form \eqq{
  \fnc{n_D}{\xb - \mub} = \sqrt{\paren{\xb-\mub}\tr\Sigma^{-1}\paren{\xb - \mub}},
} for positive definite matrix $\Sigma$. Then, the shape set is an ellipsoid with axes determined by the ranked eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ and whose directions are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. The homogeneity property also holds since \eqq{
  \fnc{n_D}{t\paren{\xb - \mub}} = \sqrt{t^2\paren{\xb-\mub}\tr\Sigma^{-1}\paren{\xb - \mub}} = t\sqrt{\paren{\xb-\mub}\tr\Sigma^{-1}\paren{\xb - \mub}} = t\fnc{n_D}{\xb - \mub}.

<!-- Under the above definitions, a density having density level sets that are scaled copies of a bounded star-shaped set $D$ with gauge function $\fnc{n_D}{\cdot}$ must be non-increasing. If we further assume that the support of the density is unbounded, then the density must be monotonically decreasing. -->
  
The *boundary* of shape set $D$ with respect to center $\mub$ can be written as \eeq[D-boundary]{
  \bdry{D} = \set{\xb \in \R^p : \fnc{n_D}{\xb - \mub} = 1} = \set{\fncD{r}{\tbm; \mub} : \tbm \in \O},
} where $\O = [0, \pi)^{p-2} \times [0, 2\pi)$ and $\fncD{r}{\cdot; \mub}$ is a polar function on the unit sphere with respect to pole $\mub$. We exclude writing $\mub$ when it is convenient and understood from context. Since we assume $D$ is star-shaped and bounded with a continuous boundary, it follows that $\fncD{r}{\cdot}$ is continuous and positive on $\O$. 

Using the homogeneity property of the gauge function, it can be shown that \eeq[boundary]{
  \fncD{r}{\tbm} = \dfrac{1}{\fncD{n}{\fnc{\tb}{\tbm}}},
} where $\fnc{\tb}{\tbm} \in \R^p$ is the polar coordinate vector for a point on the unit sphere $\S^{p-1}$ with respect to pole $\mub$. Equation \eqref{Eq:boundary} defines a one-to-one relationship between the gauge function and the polar function of $\pd D$ for points on the boundary of $\S^{p-1}$. This relationship is important and convenient in that the estimation of a \mbox{set $D \ss \R^p$} can be approached as an estimation problem for a polar function $\fncD{r}{\tbm}$ on $\O$.

For an example in the bivariate setting, suppose $D$ is a shape set with respect to center $\mub$ having gauge function $\fncD{n}{\xb - \mub}$, and $\fncD{r}{\t}$ is the polar function for the boundary of the shape set. Let $\yb = \xb - \mub$ be any point in $\R^2$ with polar coordinates $\paren{\t_{\yb}, \rho_{\yb}}$ where $\t_{\yb} \in [0, 2\pi)$ and $\rho_{\yb} = \twonorm{\yb}_2$. Then the Cartesian coordinates for $\yb$ can be written in terms of the polar coordinates, \eqq{
  \yb = \paren{\rho_{\yb}\cos\t_{\yb}, \rho_{\yb}\sin\t_{\yb}} = \rho_{\yb}\paren{\cos\t_{\yb}, \sin\t_{\yb}} = \rho_{\yb}\ub_{\yb},
} where $\ub_{\yb} \in \S^{1}$ in the direction of $\yb$. Since the shape set is defined in terms of its gauge function, \eqq{
  D = \set{\yb\in\R^2 : \fncD{n}{\yb} < 1} = \set{\yb\in\R^2 : \fncD{n}{\rho_{\yb}\ub_{\yb}} < 1}.
} From the homogeneity property of the gauge function, it follows that \begin{align*}
  D &= \set{\yb\in\R^2 : \rho_{\yb}\fncD{n}{\ub_{\yb}} < 1} 
    = \set{\yb\in\R^2 : \rho_{\yb} < \frac{1}{\fncD{n}{\ub_{\yb}}}}
    = \set{\yb \in \R^2 : \rho_{\yb} < \fncD{r}{\t_{\yb}}},
  \end{align*}
showing the one-to-one relationship between $\fncD{n}{\cdot}$ and $\fncD{r}{\cdot}$ in Equation \eqref{Eq:boundary}.

For a continuous \ac{pdf} $f$ on $\R^p$, we define the *density level sets* as \eqq{
  \set{f > c} \coloneqq \set{\xb \in \R^p : \fnc{f}{\xb} > c}, \qquad 0 < c < c_0 \coloneqq \sup f.
} 

Let $\cal D\!_{\textit{p}}$ denote the class of all bounded open star-shaped sets $D \subset \R^p$ for which the open \mbox{cone $D_{\nf} = \bigcup_nnD$} is convex and for which the gauge function $\fnc{n_D}{\cdot}$ is continuous. A distribution $F$ on $\R^p$ has a \ac{pdf} in the *class of densities with homothetic level sets*, denoted $f \in \fnc{\HC{D}}{\mathrm{\mub, \mathit{f}_0, \gbm}}$, if the density has the form: \eeq[homo-dens]{
    \fnc{f}{\xb} = \fnc{f_0}{\fnc{n_D}{\xb - \mub}; \gbm}, \qquad \text{for } \xb \in \R^p,
} where $D$ is the shape set with gauge function $n\!_D$, $\mub \in \R^p$ is the location parameter, $\gbm$ is the parameter vector for the density generator, $f_0:[0,\nf)\to \paren{0, \nf}$, that is decreasing, positive, and continuous. For convenience, we write $f \in \HC{D}$ and exclude $\mub$, $f_0$, and $\gbm$ when their specification is not needed.

For a density function $f \in \HC{D}$, any density level set is a scaled copy of shape set $D$, and density level sets are defined as \eqq{
  \set{f > c} \coloneqq s_cD, \qquad 0 < c < c_0 \coloneqq \sup\!f, \ f \in \HC{D},
} for constant $s_c > 0$ corresponding to the choice of level $c$. We can find $c$ such that $\set{f > c}$ corresponds to probability level $p \in (0, 1)$ by finding the value of $s_c$ for which $\int_{s_cD}\fnc{f}{\xb}d\xb = p$. The boundary of a level set is defined as \eqq{
  \bdry{\set{f > c}} \coloneqq \set{\xb \in \R^p : \fnc{f}{\xb} = c},
} implying that for a density $f \in \HC{D}$, $\fnc{f}{\xb}$ is constant for any $\xb$ on the boundary of level set $\set{f > c}$.

The *star-generalized radius variable* is a non-negative random variable defined as \eqq{
  R \coloneq \fncD{n}{\Xb - \mub}, \qquad \Xb \in \R^p,
} for shape set $D$ with gauge function $\fncD{n}{\cdot}$ and center $\mub\in\R^p$. Since the star-generalized radius variable $R$ is a transformation of the random variable $\Xb$, we denote an observed star-generalized radius as $r_{\xb}$ or $r_i$ corresponding to observation $\xb$ or $\xb_i$, respectively.

For a random vector $\Xb$ with density $f\in\HC{D}$ on $\R^p$, suppose we are given shape set $D\ss\R^p$ with gauge function $n\!_D$ and center $\mub\in\R^p$. Then, we can rewrite $\Xb$ as, \eqq{
  \Xb = \twonorm{\Xb - \mub}_2\dfrac{\Xb - \mub}{\twonorm{\Xb - \mub}_2} = \twonorm{\Xb - \mub}_2\Ub,
} where $\Ub$ gives the direction of $\Xb$ as a point on $\S^{p-1}$. By the homogeneity property of the gauge function and Equation \eqref{Eq:boundary}, the star-generalized radius variable is \eeq[stargen]{
  R = \fncD{n}{\Xb - \mub} = \twonorm{\Xb - \mub}_2\fncD{n}{\Ub} = \dfrac{\Rho}{\fncD{r}{\Tbm}},
} where $\Rho$ and $\Tbm$ are the radial variable and polar angle vector of $\Xb$. For $\Xb = \xb$, the star-generalized radius $r_{\xb}$ is the radial component of $\xb$ divided by the distance from $\mub$ to the boundary of $D$ in the direction of $\xb$.
