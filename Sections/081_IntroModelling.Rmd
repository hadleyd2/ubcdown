Given a dataset $\xb_1, \dots, \xb_n$ generated from a distribution with \mbox{\ac{pdf} $f\in\HC{D}$}, of primary interest is the estimation \mbox{of $f$} and performing inference on the population's parameters. In general, estimation of a \mbox{density $f \in \HC{D}$} requires \mbox{estimating $\mub$, $D$ and $f_0$}. Estimates of the shape set and its center, $\est{D}$ and $\est{\mub}$, respectively, can be combined into the corresponding gauge \mbox{function, $\fncD[\est{D}]{n}{\xb - \est{\mub}}$}. Applying the gauge function to the data produces a pseudo-sample of the star-generalized radius variables, \eqq{
  \est{r}_i = \fncD[\est{D}]{n}{\xb_i - \est{\mub}}, \qquad \text{for }i = 1, \dots, n,
} which is used to estimate the density generator. This process can be repeated, using the estimated density generator to update the estimates \mbox{for $D$ and $\mub$} which in turn are used to update the estimate of the density generator, similar to the EM-Algorithm \citep{Dempster1977}. This general estimation approach, which we call the "iterative approach", does not yet appear in the existing literature and is presented in detail in Section \@ref(S:estimation-dg).

A general framework for estimating the shape set is presented in \citet{Ferreira2005} and uses free-knot splines with \ac{rjmcmc} to produce samples from the posterior distribution of $D$. This framework leads directly to inference on the shape set, but assumes knowledge of the density generator. While this method performs well on our simulated data, it is computationally intensive and requires many inputs from the user such as prior distributions and tuning parameters.

The nonparametric shape set estimator of \citet{Kamiya2019} applies a transformation to the kernel density estimator of direction to produce an estimator that it is strongly consistent with respect to the Hausdorff distance and does not require knowledge of the density generator. This latter fact implies that this estimator is a reasonable starting point for our iterative approach. The authors neither discuss the use of this estimator as part of the larger density estimation problem nor do they analyze the performance of the estimator for various tail behaviors of the underlying density. Our empirical studies on simulated data indicate that the estimator may perform better on light-tailed data than heavy-tailed data.

Parametric estimators for the shape set offer an alternative estimation approach and are presented in \citet{Liebscher2016}. By combining a parametric shape set estimator with either a parametric or non-parametric estimator for the density generator, the authors develop both fully parametric and semiparametric estimators for the entire density. This approach is constrained by requiring $D$ to have a known parametric form symmetric about the origin with $\Exp{R^2} < \nf$.

Flexible parametric families with few, interpretable parameters are desireable for density estimation and inference as they allow for estimation via maximum likelihood. Under regularity conditions \citep[Section 6.1]{Hogg2005}, the maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically normally distributed and inference follows directly from the observed information matrix and deviance function. This motivates the search for such parametric families. Fully parametric model classes are introduced \mbox{in \citet{Liebscher2020}} enabling the maximum likelihood approach to \mbox{estimating $f \in \HC{D}$}, but require the choice of a parametric form from separate classes of candidate distributions.

We introduce a fully parametric subclass of star-shaped distributions on $\R^2$ with \mbox{densities $f \in \HC{D}$} called the trochoidal distributions in Section \@ref(SS:trochoidal-dist), characterized by having density level sets whose boundaries can be traced by centered trochoids. This class is the union of the epitrochoidal and hypotrochoidal distribution families also introduced here and generalizes the elliptical class since an ellipse is a \mbox{trochoid \citep{Pedoe1975}}. The trochoidal distributions comprise a flexible class of parametric distributions with only a few parameters that can be estimated via maximum likelihood so that inference follows as \mbox{in \citet{Liebscher2020}}. The parameters have straightforward interpretations regarding the degree, direction, and number of directions of dependence.
