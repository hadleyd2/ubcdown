Given a dataset generated from a distribution with \ac{pdf} $f\in\HC{D}$, of primary interest is the estimation of $f$ and performing inference on the population's parameters. In general, estimation of $f \in \HC{D}$ involves estimation of $\mub$, $D$ and $f_0$. Given a dataset $\xb_1, \dots, \xb_n$, an estimate of the shape set, $\est{D}$, and center, $\est{\mub}$, can be combined into the corresponding gauge function, $\fncD[\est{D}]{n}{\xb - \est{\mub}}$, which produces estimates of the star-generalized radii, $\est{r}_i = \fncD[\est{D}]{n}{\xb_i - \est{\mub}}$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$. These estimates can then be used to estimate the density generator. This process can be repeated, using the estimated density generator to update the shape set estimate and vise-versa until convergence, similar to the EM-Algorithm \citep{Dempster1977}. This general estimation approach, which we call the "iterative approach" and apply to simulated data in Section \@ref(S:estimation-dg), does not appear in the existing literature.

A general framework for estimating the shape set is presented in \citet{Ferreira2005} and uses free-knot splines with \ac{rjmcmc} to produce samples from the posterior distribution of $D$. This framework leads directly to inference on the shape set, but assumes knowledge of the density generator. While this method performs well on our simulated data, it is computationally intensive and requires many inputs from the user such as prior distributions and tuning parameters.

The nonparametric shape set estimator of \citet{Kamiya2019} applies a transformation to the kernel density estimator of direction and is very promising in that it is strongly consistent with respect to the Hausdorff distance and does not require knowledge of the density generator. This latter fact implies that this estimator is a reasonable starting point for our iterative approach. The authors neither discuss the use of this estimator as part of the larger density estimation problem nor do they analyze the performance of the estimator for various tail behaviors of the underlying density. Our empirical studies on simulated data indicate that the estimator may perform better on light-tailed data than heavy-tailed data.

Parametric estimators for the shape set offer an alternative estimation approach and are presented in \citet{Liebscher2016}. This approach combines a parametric shape set estimator with either a parametric or non-parametric estimator for the density generator to derive both fully parametric and semiparametric estimators for the entire density, respectively. This approach is constrained by requiring $D$ to have a known parametric form symmetric about the origin with $\Exp{R^2} < \nf$.

Flexible parametric families with few, interpretable parameters are desireable for density estimation and inference as they allow for estimation via maximum likelihood. Under regularity conditions \citep[Section 6.1]{Hogg2005}, the maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically normally distributed and inference follows directly from the observed information matrix and deviance function. This motivates the search for such parametric families. Fully parametric model classes are introduced \mbox{in \citet{Liebscher2020}} enabling the maximum likelihood approach to estimating $f \in \HC{D}$, but require the assumption of a parametric form from separate classes of distributions.

We introduce a fully parametric subclass of star-shaped distributions on $\R^2$ with densities \mbox{$f \in \HC{D}$} called the trochoidal distributions, characterized by having density level sets whose boundaries can be traced by centered trochoids. This class is the union of the epitrochoidal and hypotrochoidal distribution families also introduced here. This class is a generalization of the elliptical class since an ellipse is a \mbox{trochoid \citep{Pedoe1975}} and offers flexible distributions with only a few parameters whose interpretations are direct and practical. This generalization is geometric in the sense that the shape of the density contours can be traced by any centered trochoid under certain constraints on the trochoidal parameters that lead to identifiable distributions with \mbox{densities $f \in \HC{D}$}. The trochoidal distributions can be estimated via maximum likelihood and inference follows as \mbox{in \citet{Liebscher2020}}. The parameters have straightforward interpretations regarding the degree, direction, and number of directions of dependence.
