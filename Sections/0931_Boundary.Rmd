The stochastic representation in Theorem 8 of \citet{Richter2014} is \eeq[Richter]{
  \Xb = \mub + R\Ub,
} where $\Ub$ is simulated uniformly over the boundary of shape set $D$, and the scaling variable $R$ is the star-generalized radius variable, independent from $\Ub$, with density \eeq[scale-r]{
  \fnc{f_{R}}{r} = p\abs{D}r^{p-1}\fnc{f_0}{r}, \qquad r > 0.
} This representation exploits the independence of direction $\Ub$ and star-generalized radius $R$. Simulation is relatively straightforward, though simulating $\Ub$ over the boundary can be computationally complex.

We can simulate $\Xb$ from density $f \in \HC{D}$ on $\R^2$ according to Equation \eqref{Eq:Richter} by Algorithm \ref{Alg:sim-boundary}.
