This section summarizes the anticipated work needed to complete this research proposal. The objectives are categorized into primary objectives and secondary objectives. Primary objectives are the stated research goals and large components of those goals. Secondary objectives are open questions encountered while performing research and compiling results for this proposal. Preliminary ideas and references are included for the objectives to give the research direction.

## Primary Objectives

The primary research objectives are to devise an estimation approach for densities with homothetic level sets, to derive asymptotic bounds and/or approximations for multivariate financial risk measures when risks follow a light-tailed distribution whose density has homothetic level sets, and to estimate high risk regions for light-tailed random vectors. We review each of these in turn, discussing work that has been completed, anticipated future work, and open questions encountered while writing this proposal.

### Estimation of Densities with Homothetic Level Sets

Most of the work has been completed for this primary objective and many of the results have been presented. An iterative estimation approach is devised in Section \@ref(S:estimation-dg) that shows promise. Future work for this objective includes studying the properties of the estimation procedure, applying the method to real datasets, using a nonparametric model to estimate the density generator, estimation of the center of the shape set, and generalizing the approach to higher dimensions. 

We can numerically analyze the properties of the iterative approach by applying this approach to multiple random samples generated from the same underlying model. We can then estimate variability in both estimators for the shape set and density generator on each iteration with the desired result that the variability decreases with each iteration.

A nonparametric estimator for the density generator is possible since $f_0$ is directly related to the univariate density for the star-generalizezd radius (see Equation \eqref{Eq:scale-r}) and thus avoids the curse of dimensionality. Since we assume $f_0$ is monotonically decreasing, we are interested in nonparametric estimators of monotone functions. An extensive review and comparative study can be found at \citet{Dette2006-monotone} and \citet{Dette2006-comparative}.

Estimation of the location parameter is equivalent to estimation of the center of the shape set for densities $f \in \HC{D}$. Little space in the literature has been devoted to his problem which has the potential to be a major obstacle in the estimation procedure. If we can assume the shape set is symmetric about the center with finite first moment, then the sample mean is a reasonable estimator. Since a density $f \in \HC{D}$ is unimodal, another option is to estimate the mode using a multivariate kernel estimator \citep{Kamiya2019}. A broader review of possible solution to this problem is needed.

This proposal performs shape set estimation in the bivariate setting, but a goal of our research is estimation in higher dimensions. Kamiya's estimator \citep{Kamiya2019} and free-knot splines \citet{Ferreira2005} are said to generalize to higher dimensions, but a thorough simulation study has not yet been presented in the literature.

### Asymptotic Approximations for Measures of Light-Tailed Financial Risks

Systemic risk has been used to encompass separate ideas and requires proper delineation. We define systemic risk as the vulnerability of a network or system in which adverse consequences of internal shocks can spread or even magnify within the network \mbox{\citet{Hansen2014}}. Our focus is on system risk in the financial markets, but this definition has been applied in ecology, socio-economics, hydrology, and climatology \citep{Hochrainer2020, Godden2011, Hochrainer2020a}.

Common examples of systems in finance include the banking system, a company, or a portfolio of assets. Each system is comprised of components, factors, or risks; the banking system consists of financial institutions, a company may have several business lines or subsidiaries, and a portfolio is comprised of investments. 

The effects of the 2007-2008 financial crisis spread beyond the financial system to the global economy, prompting a call by governments and regulators to measure and control systemic risk in the financial industry. In the United States, this culminated in the over 2000 page Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act prompting practitioners and academics to devise data collection practices and meaningful measurements of systemic risk \citep{Acharya2013}. Regulations imposed on financial institutions to prevent or soften the impact of a financial crisis as well as to understand the sources of risk that lead to a crisis motivate the need for measuring and managing systemic risk.

The review by \citet{Bisias2012} presents 8 definitions of systemic risk and over 30 systemic risk measures, suggesting systemic risk is multifaceted and requires multiple measures. Three important characteristics of systemic risk are contagion, universality, and negative externality \citep{Lin2018}. This research focuses on contagion, which refers to the potential loss to the entire system when one or more components experience a large loss, the loss to one or more components when the system experiences a large loss, or the loss to one or more components when other components experience large losses.

Formally, a risk measure $\vphi:[0, \nf)^n \to \R$ is a mapping from $\R^n$ to $\R$ for $n \geq 2$. Adopting the notation of \citet{Ling2019}, let $\Xb = \paren{X_1, \dots, X_p}$ and $\Yb = \paren{Y_1, \dots, Y_{p'}}$ for $p, p' \geq 1$ be two random vectors pertaining to $p$ and $p'$ components in a system. The _marginal moment excess_ is defined as \eqq{
  \fnc{E}{\ub, \vb; r} \coloneqq \Exp{\paren{\Yb - \vb}_{+}^{r} \mmid \Xb > \ub}, \qquad \ub \in \R^p, \ \vb \in \R^{p'}, \ r \in \set{0} \cup \N,
} where $\N$ denotes the set of natural numbers. For $r=0$ and indicator function $\Ibb{\cdot}$, \eqq{
  \fnc{E}{\ub, \vb; 0} = \Exp{\Ibb{\Yb > \vb}\mmid \Xb > \ub}
} is known as \ac{ctp}. Similarly, the _marginal moment shortfall_ is defined as \eqq{
  \fnc{S}{\ub; r} \coloneqq \Exp{\Yb^{r} \mmid \Xb > \ub}, \qquad \ub \in \R^p, \ r \in \N.
}

As shown by \citet{Ling2019}, popular risk measures such as \ac{mme}, \ac{mes}, and \ac{mctm} can be derived from $\fnc{E}{\ub, \vb; r}$ and $\fnc{S}{\ub; r}$. For example, \ac{mme} is calculated as $\fnc{E}{\ub, \vb; 1}$, \ac{mes} is equivalent to $\fnc{S}{\ub; 1}$, and \ac{mctm} is the ratio of the marginal moment excess and the conditional tail probability, \eqq{
  \Exp{\paren{\Yb - \vb}^r \mmid \paren{\Xb > \ub, \Yb > \vb}} = \dfrac{\fnc{E}{\ub, \vb; r}}{\fnc{E}{\ub, \vb; 0}}.
} These risk measures use estimates of the conditional joint distributions of the components to estimate systemic risk, and common choices for the components of $\ub$ and $\vb$ are the marginal \ac{var}'s of the corresponding risks.

Empirical estimators for risk measures are only appropriate in the region where data exist. For example, the empirical distribution for a dataset with $n$ observations can estimate up to probability \mbox{level $p = n/(n+1)$}. Entities like banking regulators and insurance companies are often interested in estimating risk by stressing risk factors to their \ac{var} at probability $p$ as $p\uparrow1$, requiring extrapolation beyond the available data. Asymptotic approximations and bounds for risk measures allow for the estimation of risk at any probability level with little computational effort.

The study of the asymptotic behavior of risk in the financial system is a relatively new field with most relevant literature appearing after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Even so, results for light-tailed risks are sparse. \citet{Hashorva2018} derives asymptotic approximations for both \ac{mme} and \ac{mes} under the assumption that risks are multivariate Gaussian and highlights the importance of the quadratic programming problem in determing asymptotic behavior. These results are extended by \citet{Ling2019} to the more general marginal moment excess and marginal moment shortfall. The goal of this research objective is to extend these results to multivariate risks following a density $f \in \HC{D}$ assuming a light-tailed density generator. 

### Estimation of Risk Regions

The third primary objective is the estimation of high-risk regions for light-tailed random vectors with \mbox{\ac{pdf} $f\in\HC{D}$}. After estimation of $f$, the challenge of risk region estimation is to determine the quantile of the star-generalized radius distribution at probability level $p$. As we let $p\to1$ beyond the available data, such as when $p > n/(n+1)$ for some dataset of size $n$, this becomes a univariate extreme value problem. The estimator of \citet{Asimit2010} provides a reasonable starting point for this research.

## Secondary Objectives

<!-- ### Assuming $f_0$ is von Mises Implies Marginal Densities in Gumbel DOA -->

<!-- By assuming $f_0$ is a von Mises function, we assume that the marginal distributions of $\Xb$ lie in the Gumbel maximum domain of attraction. This claim is taken from \citet[p. 7]{Hou2017}, but is stated without citation or proof. If this fact is used in our analysis, it needs to be proven. -->

<!-- ### Marginal Distribution of Direction and $\fncD{r}{\t}$ -->

<!-- Assume bivariate random vector $\Xb \sim \dist{N}{\zerob, \Sigma}$ has polar coordinates $\paren{\Rho, \T}\tr$. Motivated by the work of \citet{Cooper2020} (though this reference is taken from arXiv.org and has some small mistakes) and fully derived in Appendix \@ref(App:conditional-expectation), the conditional expectation $\Exp{\Rho | \T = \t}$ is equivalent up to proportion to the polar function $\fncD{r}{\t}$. Combining this observation with \citet[Lemma 3.1]{Kamiya2019}, it appears that an unnormalized marginal density of direction is $\fncD{r}{\t}$ in $\R^2$. I would like to prove/disprove this conjecture for densities $f \in \HC{D}$ for $\R^p$, $p \geq 2$. If true, this would make simulation via the stochastic representation of Section \@ref(sim-boundary) easier than simulating over the shape set. -->

<!-- ### Estimating Shape Set Boundary up to Proportion -->

<!-- As shown for the bivariate normal distribution family in Section \@ref(SSS:shape-set-scaling), the proportionality constant $\ka$ is inconsequential when estimating $\ka\fncD{r}{\t}$ versus estimating $\fncD{r}{\t}$ due to the homogeneity of the gauge function and its one-to-one relationship to $\fncD{r}{\cdot}$. Further analysis is necessary to show this conclusion holds in general for $f \in \HC{D}$. -->

### Free-Knot Splines

Free-knot splines presented in Section \@ref(SSS:free-knot-splines) provide a shape set estimator that performs well under the right assumptions, but work is needed to understand the consequences for misspecifying the density generator. One way to address misspecification is to for proposals to change the density generator. However, this adds complexity to the estimator in the form of:

  (i) computational intensity - the algorithm already takes a long time to run, so adding more variables is likely to increase the computational load multiplicatively;
  (i) complex calculations - acceptance probabilities are relatively simple in the \ac{rjmcmc} algorithm of \citet{Ferreira2005}, but adding prior and proposal densities for the density generator might make the calculations intractable, particularly if we allow the class of density generators to change. A major complication arises if classes of density generators have different numbers of parameters. The Jacobian for inter-dimensional moves is $1$ for the current version of the \ac{rjmcmc} algorithm \citep{Lindstrom2002}, but this is likely to change as the inputs grow and the Jacobian may need derivation.

To speed up the convergence of the \ac{rjmcmc} algorithm to the posterior distribution, we can incorporate informed priors and proposal densities for the knot values based on Kamiya's estimator.

Other changes to investigate the improvement of the \ac{rjmcmc} algorithm for free-knot splines is a Dirichlet prior on knot directions to prevent knots that are too close while implementing a locality heuristic \citep{Zhou2001} for the proposal of new knots. The Dirichlet prior should help avoid knots that are too close together in regions with little data. The locality heuristic states that newly accepted knots are likely to occur in regions where the curve is fluctuating and additional knots should have higher probabilities of being proposed in these regions.
  
### Trochoidal Distributions

Trochoids are in the domain of glissettes and roulettes, which generalize curves beyond epitrochoids and hypotrochoids. Rigorous studies of such curves are given in \citet{Putnam2012, Yates1947}. The generalization relaxes the constraint that the fixed and/or rolling objects are circles. For example, one may trace a point on an ellipse as one ellipse rolls around the inside of some fixed ellipse. However, the resulting curves may not have parametric equations with only a few, interpretable inputs.
  
While it is relatively simple to rotate a trochoid to create a surface, I have yet to find a construction of surfaces similar to the construction of trochoids. Thus, trochoidal distributions may not generalize to higher dimensions.
  
  <!-- - Estimation of the trochoid using the EM-Algorithm: The difficulty in finding an EM-Algorithm for trochoidal distributions is in the mapping of parametric equation argument $t$ and the resulting point's polar angle, $\t$. I believe this would be necessary to calculate the partial derivatives with respect to the shape set's parameters. There may be other representations of trochoids that are more convenient and a thorough review of the relevant literature is required. -->

### Assessing Estimation Performance and Model Selection {#SSS:assessing-performance}

For estimates of the shape set, the symmetric difference has been used by \citet{Cai2011}.

For selection of the density generator, we can use the modified Anderson-Darling test \citep{Sinclair1990} or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess the fit of the tail for the distribution of the star-generalized radius variable. For parametric forms, \ac{aic} \citep{Akaike1974} and \ac{bic} \citep{Schwarz1978} are commonly used. If we include nonparametric estimators for the density generator, criteria to select among nonparametric and parametric estimators should be compiled.
