The stochastic representation from Proposition 1 in \citet{Hou2017} is \eeq[Hou]{
  \Xb = \mub + S\Ub,
} where $\Ub$ is simulated uniformly over $D$ and scaling variable $S$ is independent of $\Ub$ with density \eeq[scale-s]{
  \fnc{f_S}{s} = s^p\abs{D}\abs{\fnc{f_0^{'}}{s}}.
} Simulation of $\Ub$ and $S$ is easy to implement using accept/reject algorithms, but complex shape sets can lead to low acceptance rates. 

<!-- A proof of this representation using the density $f_S$ is provided in Appendix \@ref(sim-shape-set). -->

In the bivariate setting, we can simulate from $f \in \HC{D}$ using the simulation over the shape set by following Algorithm \ref{Alg:sim-shapeset}. The efficiency of this algorithm is affected by the ratio of the area of the shape set to the area of the smallest circle that covers the shape set.
